## Countdown Timer

QuickMathes includes a countdown timer feature for each question to help you manage your time efficiently. This feature ensures that you stay on track and complete your calculations within a specified time limit.

### How to Use the Countdown Timer

1. Start QuickMathes by running the following command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. When prompted with a question, the countdown timer will automatically start.
3. You will have a limited amount of time to answer each question. The remaining time will be displayed on the screen.
4. If the time runs out, the question will be marked as unanswered, and you will move on to the next question.

This feature is particularly useful for timed quizzes and practice sessions, helping you improve your speed and accuracy in mathematical calculations.
